Instructions to play the game:

The robot is set to do one of three actions (at random):
1) It will do nothing - this is to give the fighter a better chance at winning
2) It will heal itself by the amount of healing power it has
3) It will attack the fighter by the amount of the difference of attacking
power and fighter's defense powers.

The fighter can choose to do one of three actions each turn:
1) It will attack the robot
2) It will heal itself
3) It will lower the defenses of the robot

After the fighter has attacked the robot at least 5 times, it has the choice
to lower the defenses of the robot. This is designed to last only 5 turns, and
then the robot's defenses will go back to what they originally were.

The user has the chance to quit the game at any point, by using Q+enter.

The game ends when either the robot or the fighter have 0 health and either the
"you win" or "you lose" screen will pop up.
